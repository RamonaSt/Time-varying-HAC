Published in: Time-varying Hierarchical Archimedean Copulas Using Adaptively Simulated Critical Values

Description: 'Plots the dynamics of structure, the dependence parameters, ML and the length of the 
intervals of homogeneity for the LCP estimation results based on pre-simulated critical values (on the 
one hand) and adaptively simulated critical values (on the other hand). The estimated model is a 
three-dimensional HAC with Gumbel generators. The underlying data corresponds to residuals from fitting 
GARCH (1,1) to log returns of DAX, Dow Jones and Nikkei.'
